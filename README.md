# Brushed Speed Controller

This project aims to create a Brushed Electronic Speed Controller (ESC) using KiCad. The ESC is designed to control the speed of a brushed DC motor using pulse-width modulation (PWM) signals.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/CosmopilotHQ/ESC-Hardware.git
   ```

## Port Manipulation

Port manipulation is a method used to directly control the state of GPIO (General Purpose Input/Output). Instead of using digitalWrite() and digitalRead() functions, which are higher-level abstractions, port manipulation accesses the hardware registers directly.

### Clearing a Bit in a Register

To clear a bit in a register, you typically perform a bitwise AND operation between the register and the complement of a bitmask that has the desired bit set.

```c
register &= ~(1 << bit_position);
```

### Setting a Bit in a Register

To set a bit in a register, you typically perform a bitwise OR operation between the register and a bitmask that has the desired bit set.

```c
register |= (1 << bit_position);
```

### Example

- Setting Pin as Output

  ```C
  DDRD |= (1 << PD5);
  ```

- Turning Pin High

  ```c
  PORTB |= (1 << PD5);
  ```

- Turning Pin Low
  ```c
  PORTB &= ~(1 << PD5);
  ```
